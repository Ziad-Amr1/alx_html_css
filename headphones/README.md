# Headphones Landing Page (Design from scratch)

This folder contains an implementation of a landing page (header + hero) inspired by a designer mockup.
The purpose of this task is to implement a pixel-conscious, accessible and responsive headerhero section using only HTML and CSS (no external frameworks or JavaScript).

## What you will find here
- `0-index.html`  — Header & Hero implementation (desktop + mobile responsive).
- `0-styles.css`  — Styles for the page (CSS reset, variables, layout, responsive rules).

## Notes & Decisions
- No external CSS frameworks were used.
- Fonts system fonts are used for portability. If you want the exact fonts from the Figma file, add them locally and update `--font-sans`.
- Images placeholder images are used. Replace them with the assets from `images_.zip` for final visuals.
- Responsive breakpoint the layout switches to the mobile version at `480px` and below.
- Interactions
  - Link hover  active color `#FF6565`.
  - Button hover `opacity 0.9`.
- Max content width `1000px`, centered.

## How to test
1. Open `0-index.html` in your browser.
2. Resize the browser to see the responsive behavior. At = 480px the mobile layout should apply.
3. Replace placeholder assets (if desired) from `images_.zip`.
